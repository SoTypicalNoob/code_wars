** Highest Scoring Word
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).
You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

int wordScore (std::string& word) {
    int sumWord = 0;
    for (char c : word) {
        sumWord += c - 96;
    }

    return sumWord;
}

std::string highestScoringWord(const std::string &str) {
  std::string word;
  std::stringstream ss(str);
  std::string highestScore = "a";

  while (ss >> word) {
    if (wordScore(word) > wordScore(highestScore)) {
        highestScore = word;
    }
  }

  return highestScore;
}

    std::cout << highestScoringWord(str) << "\n";

    return 0;
